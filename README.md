# **Script Supplement for Research Article in Psychotherapy Journal**

## Purpose and Functionality:
This script serves as a supplement to the research article published in the Psychotherapy Journal. 
It implements statistical analyses related to permutation distributions, confidence intervals (CI), and Highest Density Intervals (HDI) to assess the significance of observed means across different conditions.

## Usage:
1. Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy
2. Instructions:
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Install the required Python libraries using pip:

          pip install matplotlib numpy pandas scipy

- Clone or download the script from this repository.
- Modify the script as needed to load your own data (ensure it's in CSV format and follows the expected structure).
- Run the script in a Python environment.
- View the generated plots to analyze the permutation distributions, CI, and HDI for observed means.

## Additional Notes:
- The script is designed to handle data related to psychotherapy sessions categorized into different conditions.
- Permutation tests are used to assess the significance of observed means, along with confidence intervals and Highest Density Intervals.
- Users can adjust parameters such as the number of permutations and confidence level according to their specific needs.
- Ensure data is properly formatted and organized before running the script for accurate results.
